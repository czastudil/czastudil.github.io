Ensuring equitable access to computing education for all students-including those with autism, dyslexia, or ADHD-is essential to developing a diverse and inclusive workforce. To understand the state of disability research in computing education, we conducted a systematic literature review of research on neurodiversity in computing education. Our search resulted in 1,943 total papers, which we filtered to 14 papers based on our inclusion criteria. Our mixed-methods approach analyzed research methods, participants, contribution types, and findings. The three main contribution types included empirical contributions based on user studies (57.1%), opinion contributions and position papers (50%), and survey contributions (21.4%). Interviews were the most common methodology (75% of empirical contributions). There were often inconsistencies in how research methods were described (e.g., number of participants and interview and survey materials). Our work shows that research on neurodivergence in computing education is still very preliminary. Most papers provided curricular recommendations that lacked empirical evidence to support those recommendations. Three areas of future work include investigating the impacts of active learning, increasing awareness and knowledge about neurodiverse students' experiences, and engaging neurodivergent students in the design of pedagogical materials and computing education research.
